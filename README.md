# Hey! I'm Zak 👋  

**If you managed to click — I won!** 🎉

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Zakarie, an aspiring analyst who’s always been curious about how numbers, strategy, and people come together to drive decisions. When I’m not knee-deep in data, you’ll probably catch me playing soccer ⚽ or dissecting the strategy behind a new business case.  

I love working on projects that connect **quantitative analysis** with **real-world business problems** — whether that’s optimizing e-commerce inventory, clustering consumer segments, or exploring risk in financial markets. You’ll find a mix of **data analysis**, **market research**, and **risk strategy** projects across industries in this portfolio, all driven by curiosity and a love for numbers.

My favorite types of problems involve using math to explain what’s going on underneath the surface — from understanding how customer behavior impacts revenue to forecasting trends based on historical data. I believe data tells a story, and I’m here to help bring it to life.

Thanks for stopping by — let’s dive in! 🚀

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 📦 E-Commerce Allocation & Sales Optimization  
**[View Full Project ➝](https://github.com/farahzak/E-commerce)**  
Simulates the role of a merchandising or allocation analyst using e-commerce sales data to drive smarter SKU allocation, pricing, and bundling decisions across regional markets.

**Business Impact:**
- Aligns directly with retail allocation logic (TJX-style)
- Mirrors the cycle of analysis → recommendation → action

**Key Highlights:**
- 🏙️ **Geographic Performance**: Cities like SF, LA, and NYC generate the majority of revenue and order volume — ideal targets for deeper allocation.
- 📆 **Seasonality Insights**: December sales spike confirms classic holiday buying trends; January drop signals opportunity for off-peak testing.
- 📦 **SKU Concentration**: Top 5 products drive over 60% of revenue, with some high-priced SKUs dominating despite lower quantity.
- 🔗 **Bundling & Association**: Strong product pairings suggest potential for cross-sell campaigns and dynamic promotions.
- 💸 **Pricing Sensitivity**: Clear inverse correlation between price and quantity sold — supports tiered discounting and markdown strategy.
