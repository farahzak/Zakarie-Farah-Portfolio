# 📊 Zakarie Farah — Data & Business Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio — a collection of business-focused, data-driven case studies that reflect my passion for solving real-world problems through analytics. With hands-on experience in both corporate finance and retail operations, I’ve created these projects to simulate high-impact work in allocation, market segmentation, and time-series forecasting.

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 📦 E-Commerce Allocation & Sales Optimization  
**[View Full Project ➝](https://github.com/farahzak/E-commerce)**  
Simulates the role of a merchandising or allocation analyst using e-commerce sales data to drive smarter SKU allocation, pricing, and bundling decisions across regional markets.

**Business Impact:**
- Aligns directly with retail allocation logic (TJX-style)
- Mirrors the cycle of analysis → recommendation → action

**Key Highlights:**
- 🏙️ **Geographic Performance**: Cities like SF, LA, and NYC generate the majority of revenue and order volume — ideal targets for deeper allocation.
- 📆 **Seasonality Insights**: December sales spike confirms classic holiday buying trends; January drop signals opportunity for off-peak testing.
- 📦 **SKU Concentration**: Top 5 products drive over 60% of revenue, with some high-priced SKUs dominating despite lower quantity.
- 🔗 **Bundling & Association**: Strong product pairings suggest potential for cross-sell campaigns and dynamic promotions.
- 💸 **Pricing Sensitivity**: Clear inverse correlation between price and quantity sold — supports tiered discounting and markdown strategy.

**Visuals:**
